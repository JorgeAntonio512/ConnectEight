Today we are proud and excited to announce the official Tent logo. The logo was developed from a design by [Christophe Antonio](http://www.designforthem.com). We also thank [Loren Brichter](https://lorenb.tent.is) for his contributions to the design process.

The Tent logo will be used to promote Tent and increase visibility of the ecosystem throughout the web. The Tent logo can be used to link to Tent entities, for "sign in with Tent" buttons, and to show a product's compatibility with Tent. In addition to digital design assets, we hope to have logo apparel available for sale in the future.

Tentâ„¢ and the Tent logo are trademarks of Tent.is, LLC. These trademarks are important both to provide users with a consistent experience and ensure technical interoperability. Because Tent is a protocol, not a piece of software or a service, there are limited avenues available to ensure products that use Tent work as promised. 

Trademark protection is crucial in preventing the protocol from fragmenting and ensuring the long term stability of the ecosystem. Most importantly, users need to know that Tent service providers have implemented the entire protocol. This policy will be expanded with the release of the Tent protocol validator, a piece of software that helps in the development of new Tent servers and verifies that the protocol has been implemented correctly. 

We carefully considered usage guidelines and requested comments from the community before releasing the logo. There is a [complete page](/trademark-guidelines) dedicated to the current guidelines. The basic spirit is simple: do not create modified versions of the marks, clearly state the level of Tent integration your project or product provides, and never use "Tent" or the logos in your product's name, logo, icon, domain name, or company name. 

If you have any questions about the logo, marks, or guidelines, [contact us](mailto:help@tent.io).

The Tent logos are available for download on the [trademarks page](/trademark-guidelines).
