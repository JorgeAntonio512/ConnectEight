**Update**: The first Tent office hours were held on Tuesday, January 22nd at
20:00 UTC. [A recording is
available](/officehours/2013-01-22).

Starting the week of January 21, the Tent team will host office hours online
regularly.

Each session will last one hour including a short talk, video, or demonstration
and be followed by a public question and answer period. These talks are aimed at
explaining the future and purpose of Tent to a wide audience from new users to
experienced developers. All are welcome to attend. We will vary the time week to
week to accomodate those in different time zones.
