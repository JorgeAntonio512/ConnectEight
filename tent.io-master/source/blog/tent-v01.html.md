title: Tent v0.1

The [documentation](/docs) for Tent version 0.1 is now available along with a reference server, [tentd](https://github.com/tent/tentd).

This version of the Tent protocol, apps, and servers are still very young and are all under "heavy development". That means using the software is a lot like living in a building that's under construction. Loud, mysterious sounds are common and things you normally take for granted might be unreliable or not exist yet. At this stage, tentd should not be considered secure or reliable. This will change quickly, but for now so **please don't use it for anything you would not want public and/or lost.** 

### What this means for you

**Developers** It's time to start writing apps for Tent and adding Tent support to existing projects based on the current specification. We've built a simple microblogging app and released it under the MIT license [here](https://github.com/tent/tent-status). Both the server and app are alpha releases. There are many bugs and vulnerabilities waiting to be found. Please report and/or repair any problems you find to the development team.
  
**Users** You can start using Tent. You need a Tent server to get started.

If you have access to a server and are comfortable running your own server you can use [this repository](https://github.com/tent/tentd) to get up and running on your own hardware. Several PaaS providers are currently working on a simplified install option. We will publish a list when they are ready.
    
Next Steps
  Tent will continue to evolve rapidly. Version 0.2 is under development and will offer several features we couldn't finish in time for v0.1. In the mean time, let's start posting, hosting, and developing! [Let us know](mailto:contact@tent.io) about the great things you build, make, and discover with Tent!

We have also posted a [list](/contribute) of ways to help contribute to the Tent movement. We appreciate any help you can offer.
