title: Changes to the Tent Roadmap

Today we are announcing several major changes to the Tent protocol roadmap.

First, the features scheduled for 0.4 and 0.5 will now be in a single point
version. We originally planned to revert to a more iterative schedule with 0.4
but [changes to the reference
implementation](https://cupcake.io/blog/2013/new-tent-server) make a single
release preferable. The features planned for this next release now include:

 - Groups
 - Server-app streaming
 - Web of trust
 - New query syntax
 - Query-able post bodies
 - Machine-readable post schemas
 - Advanced subscriptions
 - Deep links

This list remains in flux and subject to significant changes.

This release is a major step towards 1.0. The protocol will likely move from
Alpha to Beta with this version. This version will include nearly every planned
feature relevant to application development. All changes currently planned for
versions after 0.4 affect only servers and hosts. It is likely some cleanup will
still be necessary before 1.0 which could result in breaking changes. However,
with Tent 0.4 application developers will have access to the vast majority of
the protocol feature set.

The addition of this feature set will delay the release. We plan to publish RFCs
for the major additions and changes in the first few months of 2014. Questions
and feedback before then are welcome.
